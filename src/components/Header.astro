    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
      With over a decade of <strong>experience</strong>, I specialize in
      transforming complex ideas into sleek, high-performing websites and
      applications. Currently, I'm a <strong>Senior Frontend Developer</strong> at
      <strong>Mercedes-Benz</strong>, where I develop innovative, user-friendly
      applications, working remotely from the beautiful <strong
        >Muizenberg</strong
      >, <strong>South Africa</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I bring ideas to life using a suite of modern tools and technologies,
      including <strong>React</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>, and <strong
        >CSS</strong
      >, to craft responsive and engaging user interfaces. My toolkit also
      includes <strong>TypeScript</strong> for type safety, Redux or
      <strong>Zustand</strong> for efficient state management, and <strong
        >Tailwind CSS</strong
      > for rapid, utility-first styling. By integrating these tools with agile methodologies
      and staying current with industry trends, I create clean, maintainable code
      and collaborate effectively with cross-functional teams. This approach ensures
      that my solutions are not only functional and high-quality but also deliver
      exceptional user experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of work, my family is my main source of inspiration and joy. I am
      a
      <strong>husband</strong> to an amazing wife and a proud <strong
        >father</strong
      > to two daughters â€“ aged 16 and a 1 year. In my free time, I enjoy watching
      movies and sport such as Brazilian jiu-jitsu, mma and football (soccer).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >Overall, I am committed to staying up-to-date with the latest front-end
        development trends and technologies, and to delivering high-quality work
        that meets the needs of users and clients alike.</strong
