I coded and maintained new and existing features for the company website, working from briefs, wireframes, and PSD designs. I integrated APIs with the front end using Laravel and managed ad-hoc bug fixes through Trello. I maintained site design and functionality with HTML5 and CSS3, creating new views, controllers, and functional code. I collaborated closely with back-end developers to ensure seamless integration between front-end and back-end systems.
