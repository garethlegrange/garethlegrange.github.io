I prototyped, coded, and developed new features for both the customer-facing website and the admin portal, starting from wireframes and building components from scratch. I led front-end development for the cart, managing user logins, sign-ups, order processing, and payments with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Redux for state management. I also developed and maintained various applications, including dashboards, admin panels, and chatbots. By leading team stand-up meetings, I fostered collaboration and ensured project alignment. Notable projects include developing new features and maintaining the order fulfillment system using React JS, Tailwind CSS, and Redux.
