I developed and maintained new and existing site features from briefs, wireframes, and PSD designs using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a strong focus on mobile web development to optimize the site for smartphones and tablets. I implemented interactive features like sliders, forms, and animations using JavaScript libraries and frameworks. I also managed daily bug fixes and worked within a Scrum framework to maintain organization and efficiency.
