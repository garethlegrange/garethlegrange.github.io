		<h1>About</h1>
		<p>
		With over a decade of experience, I specialize in transforming complex ideas
		into sleek, high-performing websites and applications. Currently, I'm a Senior
		Frontend Developer at Webafrica, where I lead the development of innovative,
		user-friendly features, working remotely from the beautiful Muizenberg, South
		Africa.
		</p>

		<p>
		I bring ideas to life using a suite of modern tools and technologies,
		including React, JavaScript, and CSS, to craft responsive and engaging user
		interfaces. My toolkit also includes TypeScript for type safety, Redux or
		Zustand for efficient state management, and Tailwind CSS for rapid,
		utility-first styling. By integrating these tools with agile methodologies and
		staying current with industry trends, I create clean, maintainable code and
		collaborate effectively with cross-functional teams. This approach ensures
		that my solutions are not only functional and high-quality but also deliver
		exceptional user experiences.
		</p>

		<p>
		Outside of work, my family is my main source of inspiration and joy. I am a
		husband to an amazing wife and a proud father to two daughters &ndash; aged 16 and a
		10 months. In my free time, I enjoy watching movies and sport such as
		Brazilian jiu-jitsu, mma and football (soccer).
		</p>

		<p>
		Overall, I am committed to staying up-to-date with the latest front-end
		development trends and technologies, and to delivering high-quality work that
		meets the needs of users and clients alike.
